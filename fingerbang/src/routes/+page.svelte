    FingerBang: All Bullets Pointin' is a first person shooter game taking inspiration from the “boomer shooter” games of old. It combines elements from games both old and new, and includes a ranking system based on player performance.

        You play as a former police officer taking justice in your own hands (literally), as you tear your way through the criminal element of the city, trying to put an end to the manufacturing and spreading of a dangerous new drug known as Strutusol.
